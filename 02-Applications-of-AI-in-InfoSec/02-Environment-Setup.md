# Environment Setup

Setting up a proper environment is essential before diving into the exciting world of AI. This module offers two paths for an environment.

## The Playground

The first is The Playground. Because we acknowledge that not everyone will have the computer resources required to build the models in this module, we have provided a Virtual Playground Environment for you to use if you absolutely need it.

Because this is separate from PwnBox, there are specific sections where you can spawn this VM. You can connect to it using your HTB VPN profile or PwnBox. The VM exposes Jupyter for you to work in, which will be covered in the next section, but you can access it on http://<VM-IP>:8888. You can spawn the VM and extend instance time if needed at the bottom of this section or any of the Model Evaluation sections in the module.

**Note:** While the Playground environment is sufficient to follow along with everything discussed in this module, it lacks in performance to provide an environment that encourages experimentation. Therefore, we recommend setting up an environment on your own system, provided you have sufficiently powerful hardware. This will result in shorter training times and enable experimentation with different parameters, resulting in a more enjoyable way to work through the module and improve your understanding of the performance impact of different training parameters.

The second is to set up an environment on your own system, which you can do by following the rest of this section. For this module you will need at least 4GB of RAM. In a majority of cases, your own environment will provide faster training times than the playground VM.

## Miniconda

Miniconda is a minimal installer for the Anaconda distribution of the Python programming language. It provides the conda package manager and a core Python environment without automatically installing the full suite of data science libraries available in Anaconda. Users can selectively install additional packages, creating a customized environment that aligns with their specific needs.

Both Miniconda and Anaconda rely on the conda package manager, allowing for simplified installation, updating, and management of Python packages and their dependencies. In essence, Miniconda offers a lighter starting point, while Anaconda comes pre-loaded with a broader range of commonly used data science tools.

### Why Miniconda?

You might wonder why we use Miniconda instead of a standard Python installation. Here are a few compelling reasons:

- **Performance:** Miniconda often performs data science and machine learning tasks better due to optimized packages and libraries.
- **Package Management:** The Conda package manager simplifies package installation and management, ensuring compatibility and resolving dependencies. This is particularly crucial in deep learning, where projects often rely on a complex web of interconnected libraries.
- **Environment Isolation:** Miniconda allows you to create isolated environments for different projects. This prevents conflicts between packages and ensures each project has its dedicated dependencies.

By using Miniconda, you'll streamline your workflow, avoid compatibility issues, and ensure that your deep learning environment is optimized for performance and efficiency.

### Installing Miniconda

#### Windows

While the traditional installer works well, we can streamline the process on Windows using Scoop, a command-line installer for Windows. Scoop simplifies the installation and management of various applications, including Miniconda.

First, install Scoop. Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser # Allow scripts to run
C:\> irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

Next, add the extras bucket, which contains Miniconda:

```powershell
C:\> scoop bucket add extras
```

Finally, install Miniconda with:

```powershell
C:\> scoop install miniconda3
```

This command installs the latest Python 3 version of Miniconda.

To verify the installation, close and reopen PowerShell. Type conda --version to check if Miniconda is installed correctly.

```powershell
C:\> conda --version

conda 24.9.2
```

#### MacOS

Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, simplifies software installation and keeps it up-to-date. It also provides a convenient way for macOS users to install Miniconda.

If you don't have Homebrew, install it first by pasting the following command in your terminal:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is set up, you can install Miniconda with this simple command:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ brew install --cask miniconda
```

This command installs the latest version of Miniconda with Python 3.

To verify the installation, close and reopen your terminal. Type conda --version to confirm that Miniconda is installed correctly.

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda --version

conda 24.9.2
```

#### Linux

Miniconda provides a straightforward installation process that relies not solely on a distribution's package manager. You can obtain the latest Miniconda installer directly from the official repository, run it silently, and then load the conda environment for your user shell. This approach ensures that conda commands and environments are readily available without manual configuration.

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -u
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ eval "$(/home/$USER/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.$(ps -p $$ -o comm=) hook)"
```

Confirm that Miniconda is installed correctly by running:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda --version

conda 24.9.2
```

### Init

The init command configures your shell to recognize and utilize conda. This step is essential for:

- **Activating environments:** Allows you to use conda activate to switch between environments.
- **Using conda commands:** Ensures that conda commands are available in your shell.

To initialize conda for your shell, run the following command after installing Miniconda:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda init
```

This command will modify your shell configuration files (e.g., .bashrc or .zshrc) to include the necessary conda settings. You might need to close and reopen your terminal for the changes to take effect.

Finally, run these two commands to complete the init process:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda config --add channels defaults
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda config --add channels nvidia # only needed if you are on a PC that has a nvidia gpu
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda config --add channels pytorch
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

### Deactivating Base

After installing Miniconda, you'll notice that the base environment is activated by default every time you open a new terminal. This is indicated by the (base) prefix on your path.

```
(base) $ 
```

While this can be useful, it's often preferable to start with a clean slate and activate environments only when needed. Personally, I wouldn't say I like seeing the (base) prefix all the time, either.

To prevent the base environment from activating automatically, you can use the following command:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

This command modifies the condarc configuration file and disables the automatic activation of the base environment.

When you open a new terminal, you won't see the (base) prefix in your prompt anymore.

## Managing Virtual Environments

In software development, managing dependencies can quickly become a complex task, especially when working on multiple projects with different library requirements.

This is where virtual environments come into play. A virtual environment is an isolated space where you can install packages and dependencies specific to a particular project, without interfering with other projects or your system's global Python installation.

They are critical for AI tasks for a few reasons:

- **Dependency Isolation:** Each project can have its own set of dependencies, even if they conflict with those of other projects.
- **Clean Project Structure:** Keeps your project directory clean and organized by containing all dependencies within the environment.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensures that your project can be easily reproduced on different systems with the same dependencies.
- **System Stability:** Prevents conflicts with your global Python installation and avoids breaking other projects.

conda provides a simple way to create virtual environments. For example, to create a new environment named ai with Python 3.11, use the following command:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda create -n ai python=3.11
```

This will create a virtual environment, ai, which can then be used to contain all ai-related packages.

### Activating the Environment

To activate the myenv environment, use:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda activate ai
```

You'll notice that your terminal prompt now includes the environment name in parentheses (ai), indicating that the environment is active. Any packages you install using conda or pip will now be installed within this environment.

To deactivate the environment, use:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda deactivate
```

The environment name will disappear from your prompt, and you'll be back to your base Python environment.

## Essential Setup

With your Miniconda environment set up, you can install the essential packages for your AI journey. These packages generally cover what will be needed in this module.

While conda provides a broad range of packages through its curated channels, it may not include every tool you require. In such cases, you can still use pip within the conda environment. This approach ensures you can install any additional packages that conda does not cover.

Use the conda install command to install the following core packages:

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda install -y numpy scipy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn transformers datasets tokenizers accelerate evaluate optimum huggingface_hub nltk category_encoders
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda install -y pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ pip install requests requests_toolbelt
```

### Updates

conda provides a method to keep conda-managed packages up to date. Running the following command updates all conda-installed packages within the (ai) environment, but it does not update packages installed with pip. Any pip-installed packages must be managed separately, and mixing pip and conda installations may increase the risk of dependency conflicts.

```bash
MuhammadMughees@htb[/htb]$ conda update --all
```
