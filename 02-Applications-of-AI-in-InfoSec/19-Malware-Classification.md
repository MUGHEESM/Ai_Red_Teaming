# Malware Classification

Malware is software designed to cause damage or unauthorized actions on a computer system or network. Malware can be categorized based on its characteristics, mode of operation, and purpose, among other factors. A malware category is commonly referred to as a malware family. We can look at malpedia to explore details about different malware families. Famous examples include Emotet and WannaCry.

Features of malware to consider for classification include its behavior or functionality, delivery and propagation methods, and technical traits. As such, manual malware classification requires a combination of static and dynamic analysis, including time-consuming reverse engineering of the malware binary. Thus, using ML classifiers to aid in malware classification can significantly speed up the process.

In this section, we will implement a malware classifier based on the technique explored in this paper, which explores malware classification based on malware images.

## Malware Image Classification

While classifying malware based on images might initially sound counterintuitive, we will explore the dataset in the upcoming section and learn why this approach makes sense. For this module, training a classifier on images has the obvious advantage that we do not have to handle potentially dangerous malicious binaries directly. By only handling images that represent these binaries, we cannot accidentally infect our system with malware. Therefore, it is more appropriate for a learning environment than dealing with the binary files directly.

In the upcoming sections, we will explore the process of training a CNN to classify the malware images.
