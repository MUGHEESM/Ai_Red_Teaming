# The Model

The heart of any classifier is the model. As discussed previously, we will be using a CNN model. To speed up the training process, we will base our model on a pre-trained version of a well-established CNN called ResNet50.

## ResNet50

The ResNet family of CNNs was proposed in 2015 in this paper. We will use a variant called ResNet50. This model is 50 layers deep, where it got its name, and consists of roughly 23 million parameters. This model is strong in image classification tasks, which perfectly fits our needs for malware classification.

To significantly speed up the training process, we will not start with randomly initialized weights but rather with a pre-trained ResNet50 model. Our code will download pre-trained weights and apply them to our model as a baseline. We will then run our training on the malware image dataset to fine-tune it for our purpose. This approach will save us training time in the magnitude of multiple days or even weeks.

Furthermore, to further speed up the training process, we will freeze the weights of all ResNet layers except for the final one. Thus, during our training process, only the weights of the final layer will change. While this may reduce our classifier's performance, it will significantly benefit our training time and be a good trade-off for our simple proof-of-concept experiment. We will also adjust the final layer according to our needs. In particular, we may adjust the number of neurons in the final layer and fix the output size to the number of classes in our training data. This results in the following MalwareClassifier class:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

HIDDEN_LAYER_SIZE = 1000

class MalwareClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_classes):
        super(MalwareClassifier, self).__init__()
        # Load pretrained ResNet50
        self.resnet = models.resnet50(weights='DEFAULT')
        
        # Freeze ResNet parameters
        for param in self.resnet.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False
        
        # Replace the last fully connected layer
        num_features = self.resnet.fc.in_features
        self.resnet.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_features, HIDDEN_LAYER_SIZE),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(HIDDEN_LAYER_SIZE, n_classes)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.resnet(x)
```

When initializing the model, we need to specify the number of classes. Since our dataset consists of 25 classes, we can initialize the model like so:

```python
model = MalwareClassifier(25)
```

However, as discussed in the previous section, the advantage of dynamically setting the number of classes is that we can directly use it from the dataset. By combining the above code with the code from the previous section, we can take the number of classes from the dataset and initialize the model accordingly:

```python
DATA_PATH = "./newdata/"
TRAINING_BATCH_SIZE = 1024
TEST_BATCH_SIZE = 1024

# Load datasets
train_loader, test_loader, n_classes = load_datasets(DATA_PATH, TRAINING_BATCH_SIZE, TEST_BATCH_SIZE)

# Initialize model
model = MalwareClassifier(n_classes)
```
