# Training Models and Measuring Privacy

## Overview

Before applying DP-SGD, we need to establish a baseline and measure how much membership information the unprotected model leaks. This section trains the non-private baseline, measures its vulnerability, and then trains DP-SGD protected models at different privacy budgets.

## Setting Up the Script

With the imports and helper functions from the Setup Overview in place, begin the demonstration:

```python
print("=" * 80)
print("  DP-SGD PRIVACY MITIGATION DEMONSTRATION")
print("=" * 80)
print(f"\nDevice: {device}")
print(f"Random seed: {RANDOM_SEED}")
```

### Loading CIFAR-10

Load the CIFAR-10 dataset. The first run downloads the data; subsequent runs use the cached version.

```python
print("\nLoading CIFAR-10 dataset...")
train_dataset, test_dataset, train_loader, test_loader = get_cifar10_loaders(batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, download=True)

print(f"Training samples: {len(train_dataset):,}")
print(f"Test samples: {len(test_dataset):,}")
print(f"Batch size: {BATCH_SIZE}")
```

## Training the Baseline Model

We train the baseline model with standard SGD (no gradient clipping, no noise injection). This establishes both the accuracy ceiling and the privacy floor.

```python
print("\n" + "=" * 80)
print("  TRAINING: BASELINE MODEL (No Privacy Protection)")
print("=" * 80)

baseline_model = CIFAR10CNN().to(device)
baseline_model = train_baseline_sgd(baseline_model, train_loader, device, epochs=BASELINE_EPOCHS, learning_rate=BASELINE_LR)
# Output: Epoch 1/20 - Loss: 2.31, Acc: 25.4%
# Output: Epoch 10/20 - Loss: 1.12, Acc: 61.2%
# Output: Epoch 20/20 - Loss: 0.68, Acc: 77.3%
```

Baseline training runs 20 epochs of standard SGD with momentum 0.9 and learning rate 0.1. Training accuracy rises from about 25% (random guessing across 10 classes) to 75-80%, while loss decreases from around 2.3 (initial cross-entropy) to 0.6-0.8. Each epoch prints progress so you can verify convergence.

### Evaluating Baseline Performance

After training completes, evaluate final performance on both training and test sets:

```python
train_acc_baseline = evaluate_accuracy(baseline_model, train_loader, device)
test_acc_baseline = evaluate_accuracy(baseline_model, test_loader, device)

print("\nBaseline Model Performance:")
print(f"  Training accuracy: {train_acc_baseline:.2f}%")
print(f"  Test accuracy: {test_acc_baseline:.2f}%")
print(f"  Overfitting gap: {train_acc_baseline - test_acc_baseline:.2f}%")
```

The overfitting gap (training accuracy minus test accuracy) indicates memorization. A gap of 10% means the model correctly classifies 10% more training samples than test samples, having learned training-specific patterns instead of purely generalizable features.

Save the baseline checkpoint for later comparison and potential submission:

```python
torch.save(baseline_model.state_dict(), "output/baseline_model.pth")
print("\nSaved baseline model to output/baseline_model.pth")
```

## Measuring Baseline Membership Inference Vulnerability

Now we measure how much the baseline leaks through its confidence patterns. We use compute_mia_advantage() to perform a threshold-based membership inference attack:

```python
print("\n" + "=" * 80)
print("  MEMBERSHIP INFERENCE MEASUREMENT: Baseline Model")
print("=" * 80)

mia_acc_baseline, mia_adv_baseline = compute_mia_advantage(
    baseline_model, train_loader, test_loader, device
)

print("\nMIA Results (Baseline):")
print(f"  Attack accuracy: {mia_acc_baseline:.4f}")
print(f"  Attack advantage: {mia_adv_baseline:.4f}")
print("  Random baseline: 0.5000")
```

### Interpreting Baseline Results

In a typical run, training accuracy reaches approximately 77% while test accuracy settles around 67%, producing an overfitting gap of roughly 10 percentage points. The MIA advantage typically measures around 0.019 (1.9% above random guessing).

The MIA advantage is modest because CIFAR-10's large dataset (50,000 training examples) provides inherent regularization through data diversity. With 5,000 examples per class during training, no single example can dominate the learned parameters.

Even this modest 1.9% advantage means an attacker gains 190 extra correct identifications per 10,000 queries compared to random guessing. For sensitive applications, this systematic leakage justifies privacy protection.

## Defending with DP-SGD

We've seen that the baseline leaks membership information through its confidence gap between training and test predictions. DP-SGD addresses this vulnerability at the source by modifying the training procedure itself. We use the Opacus library (covered in the Overview section) to train two DP-SGD models at the privacy budgets discussed earlier: ε=10 and ε=3.

Import the Opacus components needed to convert standard training into DP-SGD:

```python
from opacus import PrivacyEngine
from opacus.validators import ModuleValidator
```

## Training with Epsilon = 10

The ε=10 configuration provides modest privacy with manageable accuracy degradation. We create fresh data loaders (Opacus requires its own loader instances) and initialize the model:

```python
print("\n" + "=" * 80)
print("  TRAINING: DP-SGD MODEL (Target ε=10)")
print("=" * 80)

TARGET_EPSILON_10 = 10.0

_, _, train_loader_dp, test_loader_dp = get_cifar10_loaders(batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, download=False)

dp_model_10 = CIFAR10CNN().to(device)
dp_model_10 = ModuleValidator.fix(dp_model_10)
optimizer_dp = optim.SGD(dp_model_10.parameters(), lr=DP_LR, momentum=0.9)
```

We use MAX_GRAD_NORM = 1.0 based on the calibration guidance from the Overview: this value captures the 75th percentile of typical CNN gradient norms on CIFAR-10. The ModuleValidator.fix() call scans the architecture for incompatible layers and attempts automatic fixes. For architectures containing BatchNorm, it would automatically substitute GroupNorm. Since CIFAR10CNN already uses compatible layers (Conv2d, ReLU, MaxPool2d, Linear), the call returns the model unchanged.

### Attaching the Privacy Engine

Attach the privacy engine with your target epsilon:

```python
privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine(accountant="rdp")
dp_model_10, optimizer_dp, train_loader_dp = privacy_engine.make_private_with_epsilon(
    module=dp_model_10,
    optimizer=optimizer_dp,
    data_loader=train_loader_dp,
    target_epsilon=TARGET_EPSILON_10,
    target_delta=DELTA,
    epochs=DP_EPOCHS,
    max_grad_norm=MAX_GRAD_NORM,
)

print(f"\nConfiguration:")
print(f"  Target epsilon: {TARGET_EPSILON_10}")
print(f"  Delta: {DELTA}")
print(f"  Max gradient norm: {MAX_GRAD_NORM}")
```

Calling make_private_with_epsilon() calculates the noise multiplier needed to achieve ε=10 after 20 epochs of training. Internally, Opacus uses the Rényi differential privacy (RDP) accountant to track privacy loss across multiple gradient steps.

### Training the DP-SGD ε=10 Model

Train and evaluate the model:

```python
dp_model_10, final_epsilon_10 = train_dp_sgd(
    dp_model_10, train_loader_dp, privacy_engine, optimizer_dp, device
)
# Output: Epoch 1/20 - Loss: 2.35, Acc: 22.1%, ε: 1.24
# Output: Epoch 10/20 - Loss: 1.52, Acc: 48.3%, ε: 5.82
# Output: Epoch 20/20 - Loss: 1.21, Acc: 58.4%, ε: 10.00

print(f"\nFinal privacy guarantee: (ε={final_epsilon_10:.2f}, δ={DELTA})")
# Output: Final privacy guarantee: (ε=10.00, δ=1e-05)

train_acc_dp10 = evaluate_accuracy(dp_model_10, train_loader_dp, device)
test_acc_dp10 = evaluate_accuracy(dp_model_10, test_loader_dp, device)

print(f"\nDP Model (ε=10) Performance:")
print(f"  Training accuracy: {train_acc_dp10:.2f}%")
print(f"  Test accuracy: {test_acc_dp10:.2f}%")
print(f"  Overfitting gap: {train_acc_dp10 - test_acc_dp10:.2f}%")
# Output: Training accuracy: 61.24%, Test accuracy: 58.15%, Overfitting gap: 3.09%
```

The privacy_engine coordinates with the optimizer to clip gradients before each update. During training, gradients exceeding MAX_GRAD_NORM = 1.0 are scaled down, and Gaussian noise with standard deviation proportional to the noise multiplier is added. During these 20 epochs, approximately 60-70% of per-sample gradients exceed the clipping threshold and get scaled down. This aggressive clipping bounds sensitivity but slows learning compared to baseline.

### Saving and Measuring DP-SGD ε=10

Save the model checkpoint. Note the ._module accessor since Opacus wraps the model to intercept forward passes:

```python
torch.save(dp_model_10._module.state_dict(), "output/dp_model_eps10.pth")

# Save in safetensors format for validator API
save_file(dp_model_10._module.state_dict(), "models/dp_model.safetensors")
print("Saved DP model (ε=10) to models/dp_model.safetensors for validation")
```

We use the safetensors format because the validation server requires it. We save the ε=10 model specifically because it typically achieves the best balance between accuracy (above 50%) and privacy (MIA advantage below 5%).

Measure membership inference on this DP-protected model:

```python
print("\n" + "=" * 80)
print("  MEMBERSHIP INFERENCE MEASUREMENT: DP Model (ε=10)")
print("=" * 80)

mia_acc_dp10, mia_adv_dp10 = compute_mia_advantage(
    dp_model_10, train_loader_dp, test_loader_dp, device
)

print(f"\nMIA Results (DP ε=10):")
print(f"  Attack accuracy: {mia_acc_dp10:.4f}")
print(f"  Attack advantage: {mia_adv_dp10:.4f}")

improvement_10 = mia_adv_baseline - mia_adv_dp10
print(f"\nPrivacy Improvement vs Baseline:")
print(f"  MIA advantage reduction: {improvement_10:+.4f}")
print(f"  Accuracy cost: {test_acc_baseline - test_acc_dp10:.2f}%")
```

## Training with Epsilon = 3

Stronger privacy (lower epsilon) requires more noise, as explained in the Overview. For ε=3, Opacus calculates a noise multiplier around 3.8 compared to 1.2 for ε=10. This means roughly 3x more noise per gradient update, making optimization substantially harder.

The training process follows the same pattern as ε=10: fresh data loaders, new model instance, separate privacy engine. The key difference is TARGET_EPSILON_3 = 3.0:

```python
print("\n" + "=" * 80)
print("  TRAINING: DP-SGD MODEL (Target ε=3)")
print("=" * 80)

TARGET_EPSILON_3 = 3.0

_, _, train_loader_dp3, test_loader_dp3 = get_cifar10_loaders(batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, download=False)

dp_model_3 = CIFAR10CNN().to(device)
dp_model_3 = ModuleValidator.fix(dp_model_3)
optimizer_dp3 = optim.SGD(dp_model_3.parameters(), lr=DP_LR, momentum=0.9)

privacy_engine_3 = PrivacyEngine(accountant="rdp")
dp_model_3, optimizer_dp3, train_loader_dp3 = privacy_engine_3.make_private_with_epsilon(
    module=dp_model_3,
    optimizer=optimizer_dp3,
    data_loader=train_loader_dp3,
    target_epsilon=TARGET_EPSILON_3,
    target_delta=DELTA,
    epochs=DP_EPOCHS,
    max_grad_norm=MAX_GRAD_NORM,
)

dp_model_3, final_epsilon_3 = train_dp_sgd(
    dp_model_3, train_loader_dp3, privacy_engine_3, optimizer_dp3, device
)
# Output: Epoch 20/20 - Loss: 1.45, Acc: 53.2%, ε: 3.00

print(f"\nFinal privacy guarantee: (ε={final_epsilon_3:.2f}, δ={DELTA})")
# Output: Final privacy guarantee: (ε=3.00, δ=1e-05)

torch.save(dp_model_3._module.state_dict(), "output/dp_model_eps3.pth")
```

The higher noise level shows in the results: training converges more slowly, final accuracy drops to around 53%, and the overfitting gap shrinks to roughly 1%. Evaluate and measure MIA:

```python
train_acc_dp3 = evaluate_accuracy(dp_model_3, train_loader_dp3, device)
test_acc_dp3 = evaluate_accuracy(dp_model_3, test_loader_dp3, device)

print(f"\nDP Model (ε=3) Performance:")
print(f"  Training accuracy: {train_acc_dp3:.2f}%")
print(f"  Test accuracy: {test_acc_dp3:.2f}%")
print(f"  Overfitting gap: {train_acc_dp3 - test_acc_dp3:.2f}%")
# Output: Training accuracy: 54.12%, Test accuracy: 53.01%, Overfitting gap: 1.11%

mia_acc_dp3, mia_adv_dp3 = compute_mia_advantage(
    dp_model_3, train_loader_dp3, test_loader_dp3, device
)

print(f"\nMIA Results (DP ε=3):")
print(f"  Attack accuracy: {mia_acc_dp3:.4f}")
print(f"  Attack advantage: {mia_adv_dp3:.4f}")
# Output: Attack accuracy: 0.5040, Attack advantage: 0.0040

improvement_3 = mia_adv_baseline - mia_adv_dp3
print(f"\nPrivacy Improvement vs Baseline:")
print(f"  MIA advantage reduction: {improvement_3:+.4f}")
print(f"  Accuracy cost: {test_acc_baseline - test_acc_dp3:.2f}%")
# Output: MIA advantage reduction: +0.0150, Accuracy cost: 14.12%
```

## Initial Results Summary

Typical results across the three models:

| Model | Test Accuracy | MIA Advantage | Overfitting Gap |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Baseline | 67% | 0.019 | 10% |
| DP ε=10 | 58% | 0.008 | 3% |
| DP ε=3 | 53% | 0.004 | 1% |

Reading across the table, we see the core tradeoff clearly: stronger privacy (lower epsilon) reduces membership advantage but costs accuracy. The baseline achieves 67% test accuracy with a 1.9% MIA advantage. Moving to ε=10 drops accuracy by 9 percentage points but cuts MIA advantage by more than half (to 0.8%). The stronger ε=3 setting drops accuracy by 14 points total but reduces MIA advantage to just 0.4%, barely above random guessing.

The overfitting gap shrinks dramatically with DP-SGD. The baseline memorizes training-specific patterns (10% gap between train and test accuracy), while ε=3 shows almost no memorization (1% gap). This confirms that the noise prevents the model from fitting individual training examples too closely.

The next section generates visualizations and provides detailed analysis of these results.
