# Analyzing the Privacy Utility Tradeoff
## Overview

With the baseline and both DP-SGD models trained, we can now compare their performance directly. This section generates a summary table, creates visualizations, and interprets what the numbers reveal about the privacy-utility tradeoff.

## Helper Functions

Before analyzing results, we need two helper functions. The first formats a comparison table for terminal display, useful for immediate feedback during experimentation. The second exports metrics to JSON for automated pipelines or later analysis.

```python
def print_comparison_table(test_acc_baseline, test_acc_dp10, test_acc_dp3,
                           mia_adv_baseline, mia_adv_dp10, mia_adv_dp3,
                           final_epsilon_10, final_epsilon_3):
    """Print a comparison table of all model results."""
    print("\n" + "=" * 70)
    print("  COMPARISON TABLE")
    print("=" * 70)
    print(f"\n{'Model':<20} {'Test Acc':<12} {'MIA Adv':<12} {'Epsilon':<10}")
    print("-" * 55)
    print(f"{'Baseline':<20} {f'{test_acc_baseline:.2f}%':<12} {mia_adv_baseline:<12.4f} {'∞':<10}")
    print(f"{'DP (ε=10)':<20} {f'{test_acc_dp10:.2f}%':<12} {mia_adv_dp10:<12.4f} {final_epsilon_10:<10.2f}")
    print(f"{'DP (ε=3)':<20} {f'{test_acc_dp3:.2f}%':<12} {mia_adv_dp3:<12.4f} {final_epsilon_3:<10.2f}")
```

The baseline row displays ∞ for epsilon since an unprotected model has infinite privacy loss.

```python
def save_results(test_acc_baseline, test_acc_dp10, test_acc_dp3,
                 mia_adv_baseline, mia_adv_dp10, mia_adv_dp3,
                 final_epsilon_10, final_epsilon_3, save_path="output/results.json"):
    """Save all results to a JSON file."""
    results = {
        "baseline": {
            "test_accuracy": float(test_acc_baseline),
            "mia_advantage": float(mia_adv_baseline),
        },
        "dp_eps10": {
            "test_accuracy": float(test_acc_dp10),
            "mia_advantage": float(mia_adv_dp10),
            "epsilon": float(final_epsilon_10),
        },
        "dp_eps3": {
            "test_accuracy": float(test_acc_dp3),
            "mia_advantage": float(mia_adv_dp3),
            "epsilon": float(final_epsilon_3),
        },
    }
    with open(save_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(results, f, indent=2)
```

We wrap each metric in float() to ensure JSON serialization works correctly (PyTorch tensors would otherwise fail to serialize). Structuring the JSON with nested dictionaries (baseline, dp_eps10, dp_eps3) makes it easy to load and compare specific model results programmatically.

## Comparing All Three Models

With all three models trained, the comparison table reveals exactly how privacy strength trades off against accuracy:

```python
print_comparison_table(
    test_acc_baseline, test_acc_dp10, test_acc_dp3,
    mia_adv_baseline, mia_adv_dp10, mia_adv_dp3,
    final_epsilon_10, final_epsilon_3
)
```

Reading across the rows, accuracy declines as privacy strengthens (67% → 58% → 53%). Reading the MIA advantage column, privacy leakage decreases (0.019 → 0.008 → 0.004), with each step cutting the advantage by roughly 50-60%. Both DP-SGD models reduce membership inference advantage relative to the baseline, but the lower-epsilon model offers stronger privacy at the cost of larger accuracy drop.

## Generating Visualizations

Numbers tell part of the story. Visualizations make the tradeoff immediately intuitive.

### Accuracy Comparison

```python
plot_accuracy_comparison(
    test_acc_baseline, test_acc_dp10, test_acc_dp3,
    save_path="figs/dp_sgd_accuracy_comparison.png"
)
print("Saved accuracy comparison to figs/dp_sgd_accuracy_comparison.png")
```

Bar chart comparing test accuracy across three models:
- Baseline (no DP): ~67% in green
- DP-SGD with ε=10: ~58% in blue
- DP-SGD with ε=3: ~53% in red

Color reinforces the tradeoff: green for high-utility baseline, blue for moderate privacy, red for strong privacy. The visual gap between bars immediately conveys the privacy cost.

### Privacy-Utility Tradeoff Plot

```python
plot_privacy_utility_tradeoff(
    test_acc_baseline, test_acc_dp10, test_acc_dp3,
    mia_adv_baseline, mia_adv_dp10, mia_adv_dp3,
    final_epsilon_10, final_epsilon_3,
    save_path="figs/dp_sgd_privacy_utility_tradeoff.png"
)
print("Saved privacy-utility tradeoff to figs/dp_sgd_privacy_utility_tradeoff.png")
```

Dual-panel line chart showing privacy-utility tradeoff:
- Left panel: Test accuracy decreases from 67% to 53% as epsilon decreases from ∞ to 3
- Right panel: Membership inference advantage drops from 0.019 to 0.004 as epsilon decreases

Both panels use inverted x-axis with stronger privacy on the right, showing how accuracy and privacy move inversely.

## Saving Results

For future reference or programmatic analysis, we persist all metrics to JSON:

```python
save_results(
    test_acc_baseline, test_acc_dp10, test_acc_dp3,
    mia_adv_baseline, mia_adv_dp10, mia_adv_dp3,
    final_epsilon_10, final_epsilon_3,
    save_path="output/results.json"
)
print("Results saved to output/results.json")
```

## Interpreting the Results

### Privacy Protection Scales with Noise

Moving from baseline to ε=10 reduced membership advantage by roughly 57% (from 0.019 to 0.008), and moving to ε=3 cut it roughly in half again (to 0.004). Each reduction in epsilon corresponds to more noise and proportionally less membership leakage. The utility cost remains bounded:

- Baseline: 67% test accuracy
- ε=10: 58% test accuracy (9 percentage points loss)
- ε=3: 53% test accuracy (14 percentage points total loss)

The model remains useful for classification even under strong privacy constraints.

### Overfitting Gap Reveals Memorization

The baseline had a 10% gap between training and test accuracy, indicating memorization of training-specific patterns. DP-SGD reduced this dramatically:

- DP ε=10: 3% gap
- DP ε=3: 1% gap

Noise prevents the model from fitting individual examples too closely, which is exactly what makes membership inference harder.

### Diminishing Returns at Lower Epsilon

Going from ε=∞ (baseline) to ε=10 cost 9 percentage points of accuracy for 0.011 advantage reduction (~1.2 points per 0.001 advantage). Going from ε=10 to ε=3 cost 5 additional percentage points for only 0.004 additional advantage reduction (~1.25 points per 0.001 advantage). The marginal cost of privacy stays roughly constant, but the marginal benefit shrinks. At some point, the model approaches random-guess MIA advantage (0.0), and further noise provides no additional privacy benefit while continuing to cost accuracy.

## Limitations and Practical Considerations

DP-SGD provides strong theoretical guarantees, but understanding its limitations helps determine when it is the right choice.

### Computational Overhead

Expect training to take 2-5x longer due to per-sample gradient computation. Memory usage also scales with batch size because we store individual gradients before clipping. For large models or limited hardware, this overhead can be prohibitive. Techniques like gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training can help, but DP-SGD remains more expensive than non-private training.

### Utility Loss at Strong Privacy

Achieving very strong privacy (ε < 1) while maintaining useful accuracy is challenging. Our ε=3 model lost 14 percentage points compared to the baseline. Reaching ε=1 might require losing 20-30 percentage points or more. For some applications, this utility loss is unacceptable. Research continues on techniques to improve the privacy-utility tradeoff, including better architectures, pre-training on public data, and advanced optimization methods.

### What DP-SGD Protects Against

The noise bounds each sample's influence on final parameters, defending against membership inference and limiting what attackers can learn about individual training records. Aggregate patterns remain learnable, however. An attacker could still infer statistical properties of the training data (average age, common features) even from a DP-trained model.

Some attacks fall outside this protection entirely:
- **Model functionality stealing**: Training a surrogate model from API queries (doesn't depend on individual sample influence)
- **Adversarial examples**: Still applicable to DP-trained models
- **The protection is specifically about privacy of training data, not security of the deployed model**

## Alternative Approaches

Other approaches achieve privacy differently, each with distinct tradeoffs.

### PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles)

Covered in the next section, PATE uses an ensemble of teachers trained on disjoint data partitions. Privacy comes from noisy voting rather than noisy gradients. The student model learns from aggregated teacher predictions, never seeing the original training data.

**Advantages:**
- Often achieves better utility than DP-SGD at equivalent privacy levels
- More flexible hyperparameter tuning

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires more computational resources (training multiple teachers)
- Works best when you can partition data cleanly

### Local Differential Privacy

Adds noise at data collection time, before training even begins. Each user perturbs their own data locally, so even the data curator never sees true values.

**Advantages:**
- Provides stronger trust guarantees (don't need to trust the model trainer)

**Disadvantages:**
- Typically requires much more data for equivalent utility
- Noise compounds across entire dataset

### Federated Learning

Keeps raw data on user devices entirely, training local models that share only gradient updates with a central server. Privacy comes from data minimization rather than noise injection.

**Advantages:**
- Strong privacy guarantees with secure aggregation
- Data remains on user devices

**Disadvantages:**
- Introduces communication overhead
- Struggles with non-IID data distributions across devices

**Choosing among these depends on:**
- Threat model: Who do you need to protect against?
- Data distribution: Can you partition cleanly? Is data IID?
- Utility requirements: How much accuracy can you sacrifice?
