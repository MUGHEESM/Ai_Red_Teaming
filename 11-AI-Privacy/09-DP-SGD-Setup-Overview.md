# DP-SGD Setup Overview

With the theoretical foundation established, we now move to implementation. Before training DP-SGD models, we need to configure our environment and understand the library components that handle privacy accounting behind the scenes. We use the htb_ai_library package for model training, evaluation, and visualization, which lets us focus on the privacy mechanisms rather than boilerplate code.

## Installing Dependencies

Install the HTB AI library from GitHub:

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/PandaSt0rm/htb-ai-library
```

## Imports

Start your training script with these imports:

```python
import os
import json
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from safetensors.torch import save_file

from htb_ai_library import (
    set_reproducibility, use_htb_style,
    CIFAR10CNN,
    get_cifar10_loaders,
    train_baseline_sgd,
    train_dp_sgd,
    evaluate_accuracy,
    compute_mia_advantage,
    plot_accuracy_comparison,
    plot_privacy_utility_tradeoff,
)
```

## Library Components

The htb_ai_library handles core functionality for training and evaluating DP-SGD models. Here's what each component provides.

Reproducibility matters for meaningful comparisons. set_reproducibility(seed) ensures comparable results when measuring the privacy-utility tradeoff across different epsilon values.

Our classifier is CIFAR10CNN, a convolutional neural network designed for CIFAR-10 image classification. It uses standard Conv2d, ReLU, MaxPool2d, and Linear layers, all compatible with Opacus per-sample gradient computation. BatchNorm layers are intentionally excluded because they would break DP-SGD's privacy guarantees (see the architecture constraints discussion in the previous section).

To load our data, we call get_cifar10_loaders(batch_size, download), which fetches the CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes), applies standard normalization transforms, and returns a tuple of (train_dataset, test_dataset, train_loader, test_loader). Each DP model needs its own loader instance because Opacus wraps loaders to track sample access for privacy accounting. Sharing loaders between models would corrupt privacy budget calculations, so we call get_cifar10_loaders() separately for each epsilon configuration.

Training happens through two functions. train_baseline_sgd(model, train_loader, device, epochs, learning_rate, momentum) runs standard SGD training over fixed epochs, returning the trained model. train_dp_sgd(model, train_loader, privacy_engine, optimizer, device, epochs, delta) trains with DP-SGD using an attached Opacus privacy engine. The privacy_engine and optimizer must both reference the same model since Opacus coordinates them internally to ensure gradient clipping and noise addition happen correctly. This function returns (model, final_epsilon).

To evaluate our models, we use two metrics. We call evaluate_accuracy(model, loader, device) to compute classification accuracy on a dataset (returning a percentage from 0-100). To measure membership inference vulnerability, we use compute_mia_advantage(model, train_loader, test_loader, device), which performs a confidence-threshold attack and returns (attack_accuracy, advantage) where advantage is accuracy minus 0.5.

To visualize our results, we use two functions. We call plot_accuracy_comparison() to generate a grouped bar chart comparing test accuracy across baseline, ε = 10, and ε = 3 models. For a comprehensive view of the tradeoff, we use plot_privacy_utility_tradeoff() to create a dual-axis plot showing accuracy and MIA advantage across privacy levels.

## Configuration Parameters

```python
RANDOM_SEED = 1337
BATCH_SIZE = 256
BASELINE_EPOCHS = 20
BASELINE_LR = 0.1
DP_EPOCHS = 20
DP_LR = 0.1
MAX_GRAD_NORM = 1.0
DELTA = 1e-5

set_reproducibility(RANDOM_SEED)
use_htb_style()
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

os.makedirs("figs", exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs("output", exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs("models", exist_ok=True)
```

We keep training conditions parallel between baseline and DP-SGD (same epochs, batch size, learning rate) so that differences in final accuracy reflect the privacy mechanism itself rather than training configuration. RANDOM_SEED = 1337 ensures reproducibility, enabling meaningful comparisons between runs.

The DP-specific parameters are MAX_GRAD_NORM = 1.0, which bounds each sample's gradient contribution before noise addition, and DELTA = 1e-5, which represents the privacy failure probability in our (ε, δ)-differential privacy guarantee. For guidance on choosing these values, see the hyperparameter tuning discussion in the previous section.

Three directories organize our outputs: figs stores visualization figures, output stores intermediate checkpoints and results, and models stores the final safetensors model for validation server submission.

## Simplified "MIA" Measurement

The previous section used the full shadow model attack methodology. Here we use a simplified confidence-threshold approach as a measurement tool. Using compute_mia_advantage(), we collect maximum softmax confidence for all training samples (members) and all test samples (non-members), then balance these samples (10,000 from each) to avoid class imbalance. Why 10,000? CIFAR-10 has exactly 10,000 test samples, so we match that count from the 50,000 training samples for fair comparison. With unbalanced datasets, this approach would need adjustment (either subsampling the larger set or using stratified sampling).

It searches for the optimal threshold that maximizes attack accuracy, returning (attack_accuracy, advantage) where advantage is accuracy minus 0.5. This captures the same underlying signal (overfitted models are more confident on training data) without the overhead of training shadow models.
