The Shadow Model Attack
The shadow model attack, introduced by Shokri et al. in 2017, remains the primary approach for membership inference. The core challenge is that we cannot directly observe membership patterns in the target model because we do not know its training set. We use shadow models to solve this by generating labeled training data for the attack classifier.

We train multiple shadow models that approximate the target model's architecture and training procedure. Since we control these shadow models, we know exactly which samples were in their training sets and which were not. We collect each shadow model's predictions on its training data (members) and held-out data (non-members), labeling each prediction with its membership status. This labeled dataset trains an attack model to classify predictions as coming from members or non-members. We then apply this trained attack model to the target model's predictions.

The intuition is straightforward: if shadow models exhibit similar overfitting patterns to the target model, then a classifier trained to detect membership in shadow models will generalize to detecting membership in the target.

Why Shadow Models Work
Consider what training an attack classifier requires. We want to learn a function that takes a prediction vector and true label, then outputs whether the sample was a member. Learning this function requires examples of predictions on members and non-members, each labeled with ground truth.

The target model's training set is secret, so we cannot directly obtain this data. But we can create our own models where we know the training membership. If these shadow models exhibit the same overfitting patterns as the target (higher confidence on training samples, different error distributions), then an attack classifier trained on shadow model predictions will generalize to the target.

The similarity assumption is reasonable when the attacker can approximate three key aspects of the target. First, the model architecture should have similar capacity and structure, as this determines the degree and pattern of overfitting. Second, the training procedure should use similar optimization settings (optimizer type, learning rate, number of epochs), since these affect how much the model memorizes versus generalizes. Third, the data distribution should match the target's training data population, because overfitting patterns depend on the statistical properties of the data.

What Makes Attacks Succeed or Fail
Not all models are equally vulnerable to membership inference. Several factors determine attack success, and understanding them helps predict when MIA will be effective.

Model complexity and capacity directly correlate with vulnerability. Larger models with more parameters can memorize more training examples, making them more susceptible to attack. A 10-layer network with 1 million parameters memorizes more than a 2-layer network with 10,000 parameters. This explains why large language models and deep neural networks face greater MIA risk than simple logistic regression models.

We also find an inverse relationship between training data size and vulnerability. When we train models on small datasets, they memorize a larger fraction of their training data because each example has more influence on the final weights. A model trained on 1,000 samples is more vulnerable than the same architecture trained on 1 million samples.

With training duration and regularization, we have direct control over memorization. When we train models for more epochs without regularization, they overfit more severely. Models with strong dropout (0.5), weight decay, and early stopping exhibit smaller overfitting gaps and resist MIA more effectively.

The number of output classes changes the attack signal we can exploit. Binary classification provides less information per prediction than 100-class classification. With more classes, the softmax distribution reveals finer-grained confidence patterns. Attacks on ImageNet classifiers (1000 classes) often achieve higher accuracy than attacks on binary classifiers because the membership signal is richer.

Finally, consider data heterogeneity and which samples become vulnerable. Samples near decision boundaries or with unusual feature combinations are memorized more than typical samples. An attack might achieve 80% accuracy on outlier samples but only 55% on typical samples. MIA vulnerability is not uniform across the training set; some individuals are at higher risk than others.

Shadow model mismatch causes attack failure when the attacker's models differ too much from the target in architecture, training procedure, or data distribution. The learned membership patterns may not transfer. An attack trained on shadow CNNs will likely fail against a target transformer. Attacks trained on CIFAR-10 shadows will fail against a target trained on medical images. The shadow-target similarity assumption is the key limitation of this approach.

Attack Model Architecture
Because shadow models serve as proxies, we should match the target's architecture as closely as possible since overfitting behavior depends on model capacity and structure. We train multiple shadow models on different random subsets of our available data. This diversity helps the attack model learn robust membership signals that generalize across different training sets instead of memorizing artifacts of any single model.

Our attack model takes as input the target model's prediction vector and the true class label, then outputs a binary classification. We concatenate the softmax probabilities with a one-hot encoding of the true label, allowing the attack model to learn class-specific membership patterns. Different classes may exhibit different overfitting characteristics, so conditioning on the true label improves attack accuracy. We typically implement the attack model as a simple neural network because the membership signal, while subtle, is relatively low-dimensional.

Threat Model Assumptions
The membership inference attacker we consider has black-box access to the target model: they can submit inputs and observe corresponding prediction outputs, but cannot inspect model parameters, gradients, or internal activations. This constraint reflects realistic deployment scenarios where models are served through APIs or embedded in applications. The attacker receives prediction probability vectors (the full softmax output) rather than just class labels, which provides richer information about the model's confidence.

Query limits pose minimal obstacles. In our analysis, we assume the attacker can query the model as many times as needed without rate limiting or detection. Real-world APIs often impose query limits (1000 requests per minute, 10000 per day), but MIA typically requires relatively few queries per target sample (just one query to get the prediction). The expensive part is training shadow models, which happens offline and does not touch the target. An attacker targeting 100 individuals needs only 100 queries to the target model, well within typical API limits.

Model owners cannot easily detect the attack. MIA queries look identical to legitimate inference requests. The attacker submits a normal input and receives a normal prediction. Without knowing which specific individuals the attacker targets, the model owner cannot distinguish attack queries from benign usage. This makes MIA harder to detect compared to attacks that require unusual query patterns (like model extraction attacks that systematically probe the input space).

The attacker also knows the training data distribution. They might possess data from the same population (medical records from the same hospital system, financial records from the same region) without knowing the exact samples used for training. This assumption is realistic in many scenarios. Consider a hospital that trains a model on patient records. An attacker working at a nearby hospital has access to similar patient demographics, disease distributions, and treatment patterns. A competitor building a similar product has collected their own dataset from the same population. Research datasets like Adult Census are publicly available, so anyone can obtain data matching the training distribution. Training data rarely comes from secret sources; it typically comes from identifiable populations, making distribution matching feasible.

Attackers with more knowledge achieve stronger results. With white-box access (full model parameters), attacks become significantly easier because the attacker can compute exact loss values on target samples. With knowledge of the training procedure (learning rate, epochs, batch size), shadow models can more closely replicate target behavior. We focus on the minimal black-box setting because it represents the hardest case for attackers and the most realistic deployment scenario.

Alternative Attack Approaches
The shadow model attack requires substantial effort: training multiple models, collecting predictions, building an attack classifier. Simpler alternatives exist that trade some accuracy for reduced complexity.

The simplest alternative is metric-based attacks, which skip shadow model training entirely by using statistical thresholds on prediction confidence. The intuition is direct: if the model is highly confident about a prediction, the sample was probably in training. Setting a threshold at 0.9 confidence and classifying all samples above it as members achieves surprisingly good results on vulnerable models. This approach requires no training whatsoever, just a single threshold chosen based on expected model behavior.

Loss-based attacks take a slightly different approach by computing the model's loss on each target sample. Members should have lower loss because the model was optimized to minimize loss on exactly these examples. Given a sample with true label and the model's prediction, we compute cross-entropy loss and threshold it. Samples with loss below the threshold are classified as members. This approach requires knowing the true label for each target sample, which the shadow model attack also assumes.

For those seeking optimal statistical efficiency, likelihood ratio attacks offer a Bayesian approach that computes probability ratios between training and reference distributions. Instead of learning a classifier, we model the distribution of predictions on members versus non-members and compute which is more likely for a new sample. This approach can achieve optimal statistical efficiency but requires careful distribution modeling.

We focus on the shadow model approach because it achieves strong empirical results without requiring access to the target's training procedure and generalizes across different model architectures. Shadow models learn nuanced membership patterns that simple thresholds cannot capture, making them effective even when the confidence gap is small.
